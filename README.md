# Welcome to City Builder

The goal of this program was to create a city-building game using Java Swing and other programming concepts learned in UNC's COMP401 class.

## Types of Buildings

City Builder allows you to construct various buildings which are unique for their cost, number of residents, and number of jobs available. You also have the ability to destroy any building with the exception of roads, grass, and water; however, the cost of destruction increases as you demolish more and more buildings.

|                |  Cost                        |Cost to Demolish                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Apartment		 |`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|Factory         |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|House           |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|
